function [pairId, dMic, alpha, alphaSampled, tauGrid] = MBSS_preprocess(c, micPos, thetaGrid, phiGrid, alphaRes)

% Function MBSS_preprocess
% This function preprocess values needed to compute and aggregate
% the angular spectrum over all microphone pairs:
% - Combination of all microphone pair indexes
% - Angles corresponding to each direction {azimuth, elevation} for each microphone pair
% - Sampled angles array for each microphone pair
% - Corresponding TDOAs for each microphone pair
% This function depends only on the microphone positions and the search 
% angle grid boundaries & resolution (array of potential direction for sources).
%
% INPUT:
% c         : 1x1 , Speed of sound
% micPos    : N x 3 , cartesian coordinates of the N microphones
% thetaGrid : 1 x nDirection : Azimuth grid
% phiGrid   : 1 x nDirection : Elevation grid
% alphaRes  : 1x1, interpolation resolution
%
% OUTPUT:
% pairId       : nMicPair x 2, All microphone pair indexes
% dMic         : nMicPair x 1, distance between microphones for each pair
% alpha        : nMicPair x nDirection : Array of angles for each
%                microphone pair corresponding to all {theta, phi} to be
%                tested.
% alphaSampled : 1 x nMicPair cell array, each cell element contains the 
%                uniformly distributed angles to be tested for the 
%                corresponding pair
% tauGrid      : 1 x nMicPair cell array, each cell element contains the 
%                TDOA corresponding to the alphaSampled for each pair
