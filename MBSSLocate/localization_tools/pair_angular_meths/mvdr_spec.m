function spec = mvdr_spec(hatRxx, f, tauGrid)


% MVDR_SPEC Computes the SNR in all directions using the MVDR beamformer
%
% spec = mvdr_spec(hatRxx, f, tauGrid)
%
% Inputs:
% hatRxx : nbin x nFrames x 2 x 2 array containing the spatial covariance
%     matrices of the input signal in all time-frequency bins
% f: nbin x 1 vector containing the center frequency of each frequency bin
%     in Hz
% tauGrid: 1 x ngrid vector of possible TDOAs in seconds
%
% Output:
% spec: nbin x nFrames x ngrid array of SNR values
