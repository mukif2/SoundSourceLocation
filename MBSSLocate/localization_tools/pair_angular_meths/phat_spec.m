% PHAT_SPEC Computes the GCC-PHAT spectrum as defined in
% C. Knapp, G. Carter, "The generalized cross-correlation method for
% estimation of time delay", IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech and
% Signal Processing, 24(4):320â€“327, 1976.

% spec = phat_spec(X, f, tauGrid)
%
% Inputs:
% X: nbin x nFrames x 2 matrix containing the STFT coefficients of the input
%     signal in all time-frequency bins
% f: nbin x 1 vector containing the center frequency of each frequency bin
%     in Hz
% tauGrid: 1 x ngrid vector of possible TDOAs in seconds
%
% Output:
% spec: nbin x nFrames x ngrid array of angular spectrum values
