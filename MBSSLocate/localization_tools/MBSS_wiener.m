function X = MBSS_wiener(X,Rnn,wienerMode)
% Function MBSS_wiener
% This function filters X in order to attenuate or emphaze a source
% signal represented by its covariance matrix Rnn.
%
% INPUT:
%   X: F x N x I, the multichannel time-frequency representation of mixture x. 
%       F: number of frequency bins
%       N: number of frames
%       I: number of channels
% Rnn: I x I x F, the covariance matrix of the signal excerpt to attenuate
% or emphaze. 
% wienerMode: string, wiener enhencement mode for the localization.
% This apply a "pseudo" wiener filter depending of the chosen mode. 
% Available modes: 'Attenuation' or 'Emphasis'
% 
% OUTPUT:
% X: I x I x F, the averaged covariance of X
%
% Version : v2.0
