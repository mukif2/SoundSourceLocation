function Rxx = MBSS_covariance(X)
% Function MBSS_covariance
% This function computes the averaged covariance of X over time axis.
%
% INPUT:
% X: F x N x I, the multichannel time-frequency representation of x.
%  F: number of frequency bins
%  N: number of frames
%  I: number of channels
%
% OUTPUT:
% Rxx: I x I x F, the averaged covariance of X
